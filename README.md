# georgejames.config-explorer

This VS Code extension leverages [Structurizr Lite](https://docs.structurizr.com/lite) to produce configuration diagrams for your InterSystems servers.

## Getting Started

> Docker Engine is required in the environment where the extension runs, which is usually your workstation. This is what hosts Structurizr Lite.

1. Install the extension. This will also install the InterSystems Server Manager extension if you don't already have it.

2. Use [InterSystems Server Manager](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=intersystems-community.servermanager)'s view to find a server, or to add a server definition.

> By default, servers run their superserver on port 1972. If any of your servers use a different port you must set this on the `port` property of the `superServer` object of your server definition. Do this by editing the JSON of your settings.

3. On the chosen server in the tree, click the button whose hover text is 'Explore Configuration'.

> The first request for configuration diagrams in a VS Code session will produce a progress notification in the lower right corner while Structurizr Lite is started. This may take up to 45 seconds.

4. The diagrams are displayed in your default web browser at a URL of the format `http://localhost:NNNN/workspace/diagrams` where `NNNN` is the free local port mapped to a web server running inside the Structurizr Lite container. This page may take a little while to load when first used.

> Each time you click an 'Explore Configuration' button a new tab opens in your browser. To avoid confusion we recommend you close the previously-opened tab, because interacting with it will now display the diagrams for the most recently explored server in place of those of the original one.

## Release Notes

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) for changes in each release.

## Known Issues
1. VS Code's extension host process crashes when this extension activates on Windows. We suspect that the `@intersystems/intersystems-iris-native` package version 2.0.2 has a bug that causes this. The problem doesn't happen on Linux, nor probably on macOS. We are therefore publishing platform-specific versions of the extension, but only for Linux and macOS.

## Plans
1. Diagrams for more configuration components.
2. Hide preconfigured entities such as IRIS* and ENS* databases and namespaces.
